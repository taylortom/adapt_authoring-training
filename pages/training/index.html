        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a simple Adapt module using the Content Team's instance of the authoring tool.</p>
        <p>Above you'll find links to two 'script' pages (where each page represents an Adapt page) which you should use when building your module. You'll also notice a link to a complete version of the training module, which you can use for comparison.</p>
        <h3>1. Create your course</h3>
        <p>The first step is to head over to the authoring tool, and click <strong>Add new course</strong>. At this point, please <strong>include your name in your course name</strong> so that it can be easily identified.</p>
        <h3>2. Apply a theme and menu</h3>
        <p>You'll probably then want to add a menu and theme to your course. For this training exercise, please apply the standard <strong>Box Menu</strong>, and the <strong>Community</strong> theme</p>
        <h3>3. Get building</h3>
        <p>You now have everything you need to get started. A number of useful assets have been uploaded for your course building pleasure, so there should be no need to upload your own (although you can if you really want to).</p>
        <div class="section sub dark">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Useful assets have been tagged <strong>training</strong>. You can use this to hide any other assets when using the asset manager.</li>
            <li>Display titles are rendered in the content, whereas titles are only shown in the Page-level Progress.</li>
            <li>Extensions must be added to a course in <strong>Manage extensions</strong>. Most extensions must also be specifically enabled for them to start working.</li>
            <li>When on the <strong>Page Editor</strong> screen, you can use the arrows at the top of a component to switch its layout.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-top:25px;text-align:center;">
            And that's all the help you're getting; the rest's up to you...
